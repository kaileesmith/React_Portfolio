I have a background in customer service, sales and brand management. I love being creative whether that is creating a website or stitching an embroidery hoop. My hobbies include embroidery, hiking, watching/attending sporting events and anything Disney related. I have worked in the entertainment industry for many years including at the Walt Disney Company and Angels Baseball. My dream is to apply my new skills to a new career in the entertainment industry.
